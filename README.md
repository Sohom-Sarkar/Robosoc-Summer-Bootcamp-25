# 🤖 Robotics Summer Bootcamp @ IIT Jodhpur

Welcome to the official repository for the **Robotics Summer Bootcamp** organized by the Robotics Club, IIT Jodhpur! 🎉  
This bootcamp is designed to introduce you to the foundational concepts and exciting applications in robotics — ranging from basic Python skills to full 3D quadcopter simulations and control systems.

This repo will contain:
- 📝 Session notes and resources  
- 💻 Python code for simulations  
- 📌 Tasks and assignments  

Whether you're a beginner or someone looking to solidify your robotics knowledge, this bootcamp will help you build strong fundamentals and apply them through hands-on coding and visualization.

## 🚀 Topics Covered

We start from the basics and gradually build up to advanced robotics topics. The journey includes:

- **Python essentials** — Learn the basics, matrix operations, plotting, and animations to build simulation-ready code.
- **Kinematics** — Understand how robots move, both in 2D and 3D, with forward and inverse kinematics of manipulators and mobile robots.
- **Dynamics & Control** — Dive into equations of motion, Jacobians, feedback linearization, and optimal control methods.
- **Simulations** — Code and simulate real-world systems like differential drive robots, projectiles, bouncing balls, double pendulums, and more.
- **Optimization** — Learn trajectory optimization using methods like collocation and single shooting.
- **Advanced Systems** — Explore 3D rotation mechanics, quadcopters, bicopters, Kalman filters, and the Denavit–Hartenberg convention for 3D manipulators.

All sessions are paired with curated YouTube videos, notes (PDFs), and well-documented Python code.
